[mod-setting-description]
xy-item-weight=Buffs key intermediate components such as [item=kr-electronic-components] which otherwise have low values. Buffs key ingredients used in buildings such as [item=kr-inserter-parts] in order to support making buildings in-situ.
xy-processing-unit-alt=[color=yellow]Warning: May cause minor issues to existing saves.[/color] [recipe=kr-bio-processing-circuit] takes place in the [entity=biochamber] and uses an appropriate amount of [item=advanced-circuit]. Locks the Cerys [item=processing-unit] from nitric acid to Cerys and rebalances it to K2 standards. Changes the Paracelsin [item=processing-unit] from nitric acid to re-align with other recipes, but uses one less [item=advanced-circuit].
xy-move-lab-category=Moves all lab buildings to the science tab provided by the Science group mod. This is automatically done if your game has >10 labs. Safe to leave this setting enabled even if it does nothing.
xy-moshine-connection-length=Increases the distance from [planet=nauvis] and [planet=vulcanus] to Moshine to 10000 and 25000 km respectively. The asteroid density is not affected.
xy-paracelsin-tech-card=[color=orange]Warning: Fixes are highly recommended to be left enabled. Affects saves already producing [item=galvanization-science-pack][/color]. Adds galvanization tech cards produced like other interplanetary tech cards. Adds [item=xy-galvanization-research-data] which is produced through normal means. Recommended with "Rebalance chemical plant upgrades" and does nothing without Paracelsin installed.
xy-paracelsin-tech-card-endgame=[color=orange]Warning: Affects endgame saves.[/color] Researches requiring [item=promethium-science-pack] also require galvanization tech card. Requires "Add/replace galvanization tech card tech card" to be enabled.
xy-adv-chem-plant-rebalance=[color=yellow]Warning: May cause minor issues to existing saves.[/color] Swaps most of the stats of [entity=kr-advanced-chemical-plant] with Paracelsin's electrochemical plant (which appears later in the game). The cost of the [entity=kr-advanced-chemical-plant] is decreased, and the electrochemical plant is more expensive.
xy-lab-recipe-changes=[color=yellow]Warning: May cause minor issues to existing saves.[/color] [entity=kr-singularity-lab] requires Mulana's cryolabs instead of [entity=biolab], or [item=quantum-processor] if Muluna isn't installed. Cryolab requires research and ingredients from Paracelsin if installed.

xy-maraxsis-moshine-connection=[color=yellow]Warning: May cause issues if disabled mid-game.[/color] Adds a new connection between Maraxsis and Moshine that is 15000 km long; shorter than the other paths. Has the same asteroid variety as the other routes to Maraxsis. Requires "Increase distance to Moshine" setting, Maraxsis, and Moshine to be enabled, otherwise won't do anything.
