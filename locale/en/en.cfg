[mod-setting-description]
xy-item-weight=Buffs key intermediate components such as [item=kr-electronic-components] which otherwise have low values. Buffs key ingredients used in buildings such as [item=kr-inserter-parts] in order to support making buildings in-situ.
xy-processing-unit-alt=[color=yellow]Warning: May cause minor issues to existing saves.[/color] [recipe=kr-bio-processing-circuit] takes place in the [entity=biochamber] and uses an appropriate amount of [item=advanced-circuit]. Locks the Cerys [item=processing-unit] from nitric acid to Cerys and rebalances it to K2 standards. Changes the Paracelsin [item=processing-unit] from nitric acid to re-align with other recipes, but uses one less [item=advanced-circuit].
xy-move-lab-category=Moves all lab buildings to the science tab provided by the Science group mod. This is automatically done if your game has >10 labs. Safe to leave this setting enabled even if it does nothing.
xy-moshine-connection-length=Increases the distance from [planet=nauvis] and [planet=vulcanus] to Moshine to 10000 and 25000 km respectively. The asteroid density is not affected.
xy-paracelsin-tech-card=[color=orange]Warning: Fixes are highly recommended to be left enabled. Affects saves already producing galvanization science packs[/color]. This setting is left as there is another mod that adds a galvanization tech card.
xy-paracelsin-tech-card-endgame=[color=orange]Warning: Affects endgame saves.[/color] Researches requiring [item=promethium-science-pack] also require galvanization tech card. Requires "Add/replace galvanization tech card tech card" to be enabled.
xy-secretas-polish=[color=orange]Warning: Affects saves that have reached Secretas.[/color] Changes a lot of the recipes in the mod to be less insane and require materials from other mods & K2
xy-adv-chem-plant-rebalance=[color=yellow]Warning: May cause minor issues to existing saves.[/color] Swaps most of the stats of [entity=kr-advanced-chemical-plant] with Paracelsin's electrochemical plant (which appears later in the game). The cost of the [entity=kr-advanced-chemical-plant] is decreased, and the electrochemical plant is more expensive.
xy-lab-recipe-changes=[color=yellow]Warning: May cause minor issues to existing saves.[/color] [entity=kr-singularity-lab] requires Mulana's cryolabs instead of [entity=biolab], or [item=quantum-processor] if Muluna isn't installed. Cryolab requires research and ingredients from Paracelsin if installed. Rebalances and applies science pack drain multiplier on quality to cryolab and [entity=kr-singularity-lab].
xy-advanced-centrifuge-rebalance=Halves the speed but adds +50% productivity to the advanced centrifuge to align it more with Space Age balancing than K2's balancing. Moves the technology from [item=kr-matter-tech-card] down to [item=electromagnetic-science-pack]. Significantly changes the building's recipe.
xy-arig-belts=[color=yellow]Warning: May cause minor issues to existing saves.[/color] Makes superior belts a continuation of Arig's Hyper belts instead of SA's turbo belts, integrating them better. Also adds a Hyper loader. All superior belts require hyper belts instead, and hyper belt recipes changed to fit K2's style.
xy-apia-artillery-rebalance=[color=yellow]Warning: May cause minor issues to existing saves.[/color] Increases damage of [item=artillery-shell-with-phosphorus] Phosphorus artillery shells to align with other Artillery shells, and standardises recipe to match Nuclear/Antimatter artillery shells. Also standardises stack size & weight.
xy-apia-biosolar-rebalance=[color=orange]Warning: Highly recommended to keep enabled, as the Bio solar panel otherwise makes K2's Air purifiers entirely redundant.[/color] Reduces the pollution absorption of the [entity=bio-solar-panel] Bio solar panel by 90% (it still absorbs pollution equal to 200 trees, instead of 2000). Increases solar output to 120kW as compensation. Standardises stack size to 50 and weight to 40kg.

xy-tech-inflation=[color=yellow]Warning: Makes the game more difficult, but recommended.[/color] Multiply the cost of technologies after the first three vanilla planets. The player is now capable of scaling a massive amount when combined with K2 features. This will require building at "kilobase" levels and encourage a third base before the late/endgame, with a suggestion of 1000-3000+ SPM pre-[item=promethium-science-pack], and >10000 SPM to complete the endgame in a reasonable timeframe. Does not affect Moshine technologies. Does not affect "upgrade" technologies.\n[font=default-bold]This setting may not be for everyone. This is only default off as it will dramatically affect existing bases in midgame and later.[/font]
xy-tech-inflation-scale=Base Multipliers:\n[item=kr-advanced-tech-card] 2x\n[item=metallurgic-science-pack][item=electromagnetic-science-pack][item=agricultural-science-pack](all) 5x\n[item=cryogenic-science-pack] (or Hydraulic or Galvanization) 6x\n[item=kr-matter-tech-card] 10x\n[item=kr-singularity-tech-card] 15x\n[item=promethium-science-pack] 25x\n[item=kr-intergalactic-transceiver] 50x\nThe highest applicable multiplier is used. Some key technologies such as [technology=quantum-processor] & [technology=legendary-quality] are increased, as well as later planet discoveries.\nChanging this setting multiplies the multipliers seen above, but not below 1x.
xy-maraxsis-moshine-connection=[color=yellow]Warning: May cause issues if disabled mid-game.[/color] Adds a new connection between Maraxsis and Moshine that is 15000 km long; shorter than the other paths. Has the same asteroid variety as the other routes to Maraxsis. Requires "Increase distance to Moshine" setting, Maraxsis, and Moshine to be enabled, otherwise won't do anything.
xy-advanced-tank-expensive-research=[technology=kr-advanced-tank] research additionally requires [item=metallurgic-science-pack] [item=electromagnetic-science-pack] [item=agricultural-science-pack] to promote using [entity=spidertron] for combat purposes
